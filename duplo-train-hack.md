# This is how I hacked my sons Duplo train to go faster - only using my voice



So my son got a Duplo train on his birthday. This train is fairly advanced. There are different pads you put on the tracks that make it do different actions. For example a pad for turning on the light, a pad for reversing the direction, a pad for playing a specific sound and more. 

On top of that you could control the train with an app (because of course). In the app you can control the speed, different sounds, the lights and the direction of the train. This connection was handled using Bluetooth. 

That gave me an idea üí° What if you could control the train using your voice ? Could that not be cool!? üòé



## Research face

Now I had to research if someone had tried something similar. That led me to a dutch guy that had ["put his sons duplo train on the blockchain"](https://thenextweb.com/news/hacker-blockchain-train-duplo). That was not actually what he had done. The train made sounds and drove around based on some events on his own alt coin. But non the less a nice project.

The [script](https://gist.github.com/roelandp/e80ccc15bc5317e9704e2ac2b3573f42) for the controlling the train was linked in the article which further that led me to [node-poweredup](https://github.com/nathankellenicki/node-poweredup) - A Javascript module to interface with LEGO Powered Up components. Apparently LEGO has made lots of components that can be controlled via Bluetooth of which the Duplo train was one of them. 

‚úÖ Was it possible to control the train - yes



## Connecting to the train

Now I was on the lead. I knew it was possible to control the train but could I make it work? 

My first stab at it was on my Windows machine. I went a bit too quick into it (story of my life) without checking the [prerequisites](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#windows). This gave me a lot of problems. When I finally found the prerequisites I saw that it was a lot easier using a Mac compared to Windows. 

Therefore I booted up my work computer and quickly got a successful connection. Yeah ü•≥ 

The script that the dutch guy had made was outdated though. The entire api had changed so into the [documentation](https://nathan.kellenicki.com/node-poweredup/) I dove üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It took a bit of time but I finally made the train drive and quickly learned to debug the train by putting it on it's side. My arm was getting a bit tired after constantly moving the train back and forth. 

‚úÖ Could I control the train - yes



## Getting the pitch of someone's voice

On to the next problem: Figuring out if I could get the pitch of someone's voice. 

I knew this was possible. I had made a [previous project](https://github.com/benna100/clap-python-project) in python where clapping would start playing some music. This was done using a technique called [fft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) where you transform the audio signal into it's frequency domain.

But the connection to the train was made in nodejs. Therefore I had to do the pitch detection in nodejs. This proved to be a huge problem ü§î I am still not really sure if it is possible. I tried out a few libraries but did not really get anything working. 

Okay so let's approach this from another angle then üîé What if I instead detect the pitch in the browser and then send that detection to nodejs. Luckily there was a great library called [Pitchy](https://github.com/ianprime0509/pitchy) that solved this exact problem. Look at this simple magnificent api with a [great clear example](https://ianjohnson.dev/pitchy/) üëå

```const [pitch, clarity] = detector.findPitch(input, sampleRate);```

‚úÖ Could I detect a persons pitch - yes



## Gluing everything together

Now on to gluing everything together. That was done using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). Socket.io lets you send data bidirectional in real time. So from the client to the server and from the server to the client. 

Luckily I had also worked with that before building an [online slime volley game](https://slime-volley-multiplayer.herokuapp.com/) so it did not take too long to get it working. The last tweaking was done around the [frequency of sending the data to the server](https://github.com/benna100/duplo-train-voice-control/blob/main/index.js#L37), how to [map the pitch to a train speed](https://github.com/benna100/duplo-train-voice-control/blob/main/index.js#L23) and [filtering the signal](https://github.com/benna100/duplo-train-voice-control/blob/main/index.js#L35) so only when someone says something the train drives
